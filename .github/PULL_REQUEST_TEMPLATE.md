## Checklist before marking as ready for review

Please ensure that your pull request meets the following criteria before marking it as ready for review:

- [ ] I have read the [contributing guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- [ ] I have added appropriate and passing tests for the changes I made using Jest.
- [ ] I have not broken any existing functionality or tests.
- [ ] I have not introduced any new linting or formatting errors.
- [ ] I have only added new dependencies that are necessary and do not introduce security vulnerabilities. These dependencies use tilde (~) ranges in `package.json` to avoid breaking changes.
- [ ] If I've made changes to the UI (of the app or prototypes), I've used the Axe accessibility devtools extension to check for and resolve any accessibility issues. New issues that cannot be resolved should be documented in the pull request description.
- [ ] I have updated the documentation if necessary.
- [ ] My branch is up-to-date with the latest changes in the `main` branch.
