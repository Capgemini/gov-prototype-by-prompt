## Manage your prototypes  <!-- markdownlint-disable-line first-line-h1 -->

On the ["Your prototypes" page](/history), you can view all the prototypes you can access.

Filters are available to:

- Exclude updates to existing prototypes and only show those created from the ["Create a prototype" page](/create).
- Filter by the creator.
- Filter by workspace.

You can click on a prototype's name to view and update it.

If your access to a prototype is removed, it will no longer appear here.

Prototypes cannot be deleted.
