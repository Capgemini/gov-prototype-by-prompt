# Update a prototype

You can update a prototype by:

- Explaining changes and additions using the plain text input in the interface
- Directly editing the JSON representation of the form

Updating a prototype creates a new version with a new URL. Previous versions are stored in the "History" tab.

## Sharing

The previous workspace is reused unless you choose a different one. If you are not a member of the workspace, your personal workspace is used instead.

The updated prototype is never shared publicly by default, but is still shared with the users the previous prototype was shared with.
