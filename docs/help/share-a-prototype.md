# Share a prototype

A prototype can be shared with users in a workspace or with specific users. The live demo of a prototype can also be shared publicly. You can manage prototype sharing using the "Sharing" tab.

Note that the user who creates a prototype does not always keep access, for example, if it is moved to a workspace the creator cannot access.

## Share a prototype in a workspace

All prototypes belong to a workspace. This can be your private workspace, or it can be a shared workspace that one or more users can access. Everyone in a workspace can access, update, and share the prototypes within that workspace. You can move prototypes between workspaces.

If a prototype is updated, the previous workspace is reused unless you choose a different one.

If you are removed from a workspace, you will lose access to all the prototypes in that workspace (except for any prototypes shared with you individually).

## Share a prototype with individual users

Prototypes can also be shared with specific users. These users can access and update the prototype, but cannot share it (unless they are also a member of the workspace).

If a prototype is updated by a user who is not a member of the prototype's workspace, the new version will be added to their private workspace. It will still be shared with the users that the previous prototype was shared with.

## Share a live demo publicly

The live demo of prototypes can also be shared publicly, letting anyone try out the prototype. This does not let it be updated or for any other information about the prototype to be viewed.

You can set a password when sharing the live demo publicly. The chosen password is visible to all users who can access the prototype.

Data entered into the live demo is unique for each user.
