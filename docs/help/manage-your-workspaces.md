## Manage your workspaces <!-- markdownlint-disable-line first-line-h1 -->

Workspaces are like folders. Every prototype belongs to a workspace, and every workspace has one or more users.

On the ["Your workspaces" page](/user/workspace), you can view all the workspaces you can access.

You can click on a workspace's name to view and update it. This lets you rename it and add or remove users.

You can click on the number of prototypes in a workspace to view all the prototypes within that workspace.

Every user has their own private workspace - this is named "Your Name's workspace" and cannot be shared.

If your access to a workspace is removed, it will no longer appear here.

Workspaces cannot be deleted.
