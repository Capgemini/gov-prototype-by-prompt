# Create a new prototype

Visit the [create a prototype page](/create) to create a new prototype.

Describe what the form is for, what fields it should include, and any eligibility criteria or instructions for the user.

For example:
> Create a driving licence application form. Ask for name, email, date of birth, preferred contact methods, automatic or manual, and to explain any health problems. Must be a UK resident and over 17 years old.

Once created, the high-level structure of the prototype can be previewed in the "Structure" tab.

Visit the [supported prototype options page](/help/supported-prototype-options) for details of the available form and question fields.
