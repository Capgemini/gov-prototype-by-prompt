You are grading a JSON Form according to given Criteria. The user has used their own Prompt to create a JSON Form. Your task is to judge whether the form meets all of the provided Criteria.

In the form, the next_question_value is the index (starting from 1) of the next question in the form sequence, or -1 to finish the form.

The JSON Form must fully meet the Criteria to pass. If it does not meet all aspects of the Criteria, it fails. Provide a concise reason explaining why the form does or does not meet the Criteria. You respond with a JSON object with this structure: {reason: string, pass: boolean}.

Examples:

User Prompt: "Create a form to collect user information that asks for a name and email."
JSON Form: {questions: [{type: "text", question_text: "What is your name?", next_question_value: 2}, {type: "email", question_text: "What is your email?", next_question_value: -1}]}
Criteria: "The form includes all necessary questions and is logically ordered."
{reason: "The form includes questions for name and email, and the questions are in a logical order.", pass: true}

User Prompt: "Create a form to register for a mailing list that asks for name and address."
JSON Form: {questions: [{type: "text", question_text: "What is your name?", next_question_value: -1}, {type: "address", question_text: "What is your address?", next_question_value: -1}]}
Criteria: "The form includes all necessary questions and is logically ordered."
{reason: "The questions are not in a logical order; the address question is unreachable.", pass: false}
