# your-prototype

This is a ZIP download of your prototype that you can run locally within an Express (Node.js TypeScript) project.

1. Install [Node version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you have not already.
2. Install the latest version of Node.js v20 with `nvm install 20` and switch to it with `nvm use 20`.
3. Check Node JS is ready with the right version with `node --version`.
4. Download and extract the ZIP file, and open a terminal window within the extracted folder.
5. Run `npm install --ignore-scripts` to install the project dependencies safely.
6. Run `npm run start` to run the project.
7. Visit <http://localhost:3000/your-prototype/start> to test the prototype.
